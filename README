Haskell LC3 Assembler

PROGRAM
_________________

This program implements an assembler for the LC-3 assembly language, a language
for the abstract LC-3 computer, intended for learning the basics of computer
architecture. The wikipedia article contains some information and links
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3

INSTALL
_________________

Build with
	ghc --make hlc3as
Run with
	./hlc3as asmfile.asm
which will produce asmfile.obj.

Not tested with Hugs or alternative Haskell systems.

CODE
_________________

LC3 exports the public interface, namely parseProgram, and assembleProgram.

LC3.Parser contains the parser that converts the code into a symbolic Program
object.

LC3.Assembler is a second parser, which parses a list of Statement objects into
a ByteString.

LC3.Types holds the internal data types for representing code after it is
parsed and some useful values such as the reserved words for LC-3 assembly and
a table mapping instruction mnemonics to their opcodes.
